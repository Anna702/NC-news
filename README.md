Bootcamp front-end project.
I was creating a social news aggregation, web content rating and discussion website.

NC News has articles which are divided into topics. Each article has user curated ratings and can be up or down voted using the API. Users can also add comments about an article.

All features a created in this repo have the associated behaviour implemented in my back end one: https://github.com/Anna702/NC-NEWS-project

This sprint really consolidated my understanding of making a C.R.U.D application from a front end perspective.
